# Atomic-Design-TR

We use this nomenclature to name all the
small elements that belongs to our user
interface. We use the word atom because
we consider our website to be the universe,
built from a series of smaller elements. The
‘atoms’ (text styles, colors, buttons, icons,
tags, inputs, handlers) form groups that
build bigger elements called ‘molecules’
(more complex handlers, a search bar with
multiple inputs, pagination, etc)

Continuing with this “cellular” metaphor we
found the ‘organisms’ that consist of groups
of ‘molecules’ joined together to form a relatively
complex, distinct section of an interface
(What’s included, Check availability,
Itinerary, Q&A’s blocks...)

The rational next step are templates. We
could say that our templates are a bunch of
‘organisms’ composed in a grid, following
a pattern, and responding to certain needs
that can always be reproduced without losing
our identity.

That’s it, the next thing are ‘pages’. And
building pages is so much easier when you
have ‘atoms’, ‘molecules’, ‘organisms’ and
‘templates’ lined up. We don’t need to think
about colors, sizes or even how to group
elements any more. With ‘Atomic’ design
principles, we are able to develop much
faster and effectively. And We also have
time to really think about functionality, user
experience or interaction. Nowadays, a
good and consistent user interface is taken
for granted..
